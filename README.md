# A context sensitive probabilistic model for natural language abstract syntax trees

This project aims to develop a probabilistic model for disambiguating abstract syntax trees for natural language in [Grammatical Framework](https://github.com/GrammaticalFramework/GF). The main approach involves using Expectation Maximization to estimate parameters using data from [UD-treebanks](https://github.com/UniversalDependencies).
