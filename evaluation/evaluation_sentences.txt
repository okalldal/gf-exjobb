he works at the bank
he works every day
she works with many people
my computer works perfectly
my computer works
my computer doesn't work
I like sleep
I am sleeping
I am working
he is working
she is a little girl
she is a little strange
she is a girl
I play football
The play was in the evening
He plays the trumpet
the child plays with a doll
The children play in the park
the play is over soon
he was in time
